# ConvNet-Image-Classification-Models
Using TF Keras to build ConvNets for two image classification models:

- Create a 1-ConvBlock mood classifer using the TF Keras Sequential API
    - Trained on 600 examples for 10 epochs
- Build a 2-ConvBlock network to identify sign language digits using the TF Keras Functional API
    - Trained on 1080 examples from the MINIST dataset for 100 epochs

## Objectives
- Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a __binary__ classification problem
- Build and train a ConvNet in TensorFlow for a __multiclass__ classification problem
- Explain different use cases for the Sequential and Functional APIs

## Results
- The mood classifier scored 95% accuracy on a test set of 150
- The sign language digits classifier scored 83% accuracy on a test set of 120
